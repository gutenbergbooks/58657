  <h2 class='c004'>A LITTLE COLORED BOY.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c005' />
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>“YOU can’t help
thinking when you
listen to that boy,”
said Mrs. Warner,
“that the Lord
must want him in
heaven. He has
such a heavenly
voice.”</p>
<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/i05.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>“I think it more
likely that God
put an angel’s
voice in Neddy’s throat to give us a taste
of heavenly music,” said grandma, looking
up from the apples she was paring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bosh! you women folks are so everlastingly
simple and silly that you encourage
the boy in his mischief;” and Farmer
Warner set down the milk pail with such
a thud that the milk slopped over into
the sauce his wife was dishing for supper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Henry, you have ruined that dish
of apple sauce,” expostulated Mrs. Warner;
“and they’re the first apples of the
season, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind,” said grandma, “we’ll find
something else. Just call the boy to supper,
Henry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed I won’t call him,” he sputtered.
“For the past hour I’ve been calling him
to help with the chores, and I’ll call no
more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then, in sweet, rich tones, came in
the melody—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O, there is rest, O, there is rest,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Yes, there is rest for my soul.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“And your body, too,” growled Mr. Warner.
“If you women had the trials I have
with Ned, you would not set so much store
by him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t deny that he’s trying, Henry;
but when one is weary and fretted with a
long, hot day’s work, it is the most soothing
thing in the world to hear the child
singing in the twilight about rest for his
soul. It rests me way to
my toes.”</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i07.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<p class='c007'>“It would rest me a heap
more if he did his work.
Now, you see when I called
him to help he was singing
about rest, but supper being
ready, he comes along
without being called even.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bare feet came pattering
along the porch
and a little black face
peeped in the window.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you call me, Mis’ser
Warner?” The farmer
grunted and drew up to
the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Henry called you a long time ago,
Neddy; why did you not come?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I camed jes’ as soon as I heerd him,
’deed I did. I only stopped to pick these
fur you,” and he placed his hat on the table
lined with leaves and filled to the brim with
luscious blackberries; then he laid a great
bunch of wild flowers beside them. Mrs.
Warner buried her face in the fragrant
flowers. How long it was since anyone
had brought her flowers! Henry used to
keep her supplied; but he was too busy
now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Deary me,” said grandma; “these will
just take the place of the apple sauce;” and
she began to pick over the berries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ned sat at a side table and did full justice
to an ample supper. When Mr. Warner
called for pie his wife gave him half of
one, and, notwithstanding his frown, gave
the other half to Ned. After supper they
both went out, but Ned soon returned and
began helping clear the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Henry may need you, Ned,” said Mrs.
Warner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No’m, he don’t; he tole me to clear out.
You put some flowers on your dress an’ go
out an’ get some air. I’ll clean up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a great temptation, and Mrs.
Warner walked through the fields to a
neighbor’s, while Ned warbled over the
dishes and her husband finished the
chores.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few months before this a lady from
the South had brought Ned to sing in the
church, and had told how anxious she was
to get a home for him with Christian people
who would educate him. Mrs. Warner’s
heart had softened at once, and her husband
was nothing loath to have a little
helper and do God service at the same
time. But they had not found it an easy
task to train Ned up in the way he should
go. A sweet-tempered little singing bird
was he, as neat as a pin and as quick as a
wink, but having no more idea of responsibilities
than the little warblers he imitated
in his throat.</p>

<p class='c007'>But his kind thoughtfulness for others
gave Mrs. Warner courage to keep on with
him, and, as soon as she had, with very
gentle teaching, made him to understand
that promptness was the one thing required
by Mr. Warner, and that the lack of it
often caused serious inconvenience, the
little fellow began to mend his ways.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i10.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was hard for him to understand at
first. The fact that a thing would give
pleasure to some one seemed reason enough
for its being done at once. In fact, some
of the unpleasant things seemed to him
hardly worth the doing.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Mrs. Warner was very patient, and
the heart that beat under the dark skin was
very loving and sweet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; I see it now,” he said one day, as
he dropped the first sweet harvest apple
into grandma’s lap. “It took a good while,
but I understand. If you are <i>told</i> to do
a thing, you must <i>do it</i>. Then, if there’s
any time left, or, if you can crowd the
pleasant thing in along with it, all right.
But sometimes it’s powerful hard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s the sky. I s’pose he’d like to
smile all the time and be bright and jolly.
But sometimes God tells him to rain, and
he just goes and does it, like a major.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t use to seem ’s if I was selfish if
I kept the cows waiting while I picked
some wild flowers for Mrs. Warner. But
I <i>really</i> suppose it was.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dear little Ned! God bless him!</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE GOLDEN RULE.</h3>
<hr class='c012' />
<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_7 c013'>LIZZIE had a present of a wild bluebird
from her auntie, who caught it when
it was a wee baby bird. It was a beauty,
and Lizzie was very happy with her pet.
One day she hung the cage on the veranda
and saw how pleased the little creature
was. Pretty soon it burst into a beautiful
song, and she saw another bird near by,
and that was a bluebird, too. Lizzie fancied
her bird looked sad when the other
one flew away, and that made her wonder
if she had a right to keep a wild bird shut
up in a cage. “I wouldn’t like to be caught
and shut up, I know,” thought Lizzie, “and
what I would not like to have done to me
I ought not to do even to a bird.” And so
Lizzie wrote a letter to her auntie, asking
if she might set her dear bird free. Auntie
said she might, and the very next morning

<h3 class='c011'>A LITTLE FLOWER MISSION OF HER OWN.</h3>
<hr class='c014' />
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c013'>“PICK your poppies every day,” said
grandma, “and then others will
come to take their place; and if you leave
a fine one here and there with a bit of
thread of the same color tied to its stem,
you will know how to sort them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So all summer Bessie picked the poppies
and gave them to her friends, who cried
out with delight over their lovely colors;
and she did not forget the poor children
who live in tenements without gardens, and
who looked longingly at the bright bed as
they passed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The seeds had only cost a nickel in the
springtime; and caring for the flower beds
made the little girl well and strong. So it
was wise in Uncle Harry to suggest this
pleasant task to Bessie.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>SOME BIBLE DREAMS.</h3>
<hr class='c014' />
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c013'>WHEN he was only a boy Joseph
dreamed that he was out in the
field with his father and his brothers binding
sheaves in harvest time, and the sheaf
which he bound stood upright, and all the
other sheaves bowed down before his.
Then he dreamed another dream, that the
sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed
down before him. When he told these
dreams it made his brothers very angry,
and they hated him, and the first chance
they had they sold him a slave into Egypt.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Joseph was in the prison in
Egypt it was a dream which saved all the
land in time of famine, but this time it was
the king’s dream. King Pharaoh dreamed
one night that he stood by the river, and
seven fat cattle came up out of the water
and fed in a meadow. Pretty soon afterward
seven lean cattle came up out of the
water and ate up the seven fat cattle. The
king wondered what the dream meant, and
when he fell asleep again he dreamed that
he saw seven large ears of corn come up
upon one stalk, and then seven thin ears
that had been blasted spring up upon the
same stalk, and the seven thin ears ate up
the seven good ears.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the wise men of Egypt could not
tell the king what it meant his chief butler
remembered how Joseph had told him the
meaning of a dream when he was in prison;
and when the king sent for Joseph he told
Pharaoh that the dreams were a warning
from God, that after seven plentiful years
in Egypt there would be seven years of
famine, which would eat up all the corn
they could save up, and so Joseph came to
be a great man in Egypt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Solomon, too, had a splendid dream
just after he came to be king in the place
of David, his father. He was very young,
and wondered how he was going to get
along and be wise enough to settle all the
questions that came before him as king.
While he was thinking about it he fell
asleep, and he dreamed that the Lord appeared
to him and asked him what he
would like the Lord to do for him, and
Solomon said to the Lord that, though he
had been made king, yet he was only a
child, and did not know how to act, and
asked the Lord to give him wisdom, so
that he would always be able to know
which was right and which was wrong, and
be a good king.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lord was so pleased with this request
that he promised Solomon not only
to make him the wisest man that ever
lived, but to make him very rich and powerful
as well.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>HOW A SNAKE CAME TO GRIEF.</h3>
<hr class='c014' />
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c013'>THE bull snake, which is quite common
on the Pacific coast, grows sometimes
to be quite large, but it is entirely harmless
to human beings.</p>
<div  class='figleft id012'>
<img src='images/i30.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>A Californian, being
something of a naturalist,
set himself to work to
tame one of these snakes
and was able to teach
Slippery Dick—the name
he gave his strange pet—many
tricks. He taught him to come at
call, to coil up, to wave his folds about in
imitation of dancing, and many other
tricks. He would coil up on the table, his
head in the center of the coil, elevated
about six inches in the air. The gentleman
would place the handle of a small fan
in his mouth, and then the snake would
gently wave the fan to and fro, and thus
keep the flies from his master’s face.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was as good as a cat to keep the old
log house free from mice. He often
brought in ten or twelve in a day. His
fondness for mice was his ruin. It happened
in this way: One day the gentleman
missed Slippery Dick, and though he
hunted and called all day, he could not
find any trace of his pet. About a week
after his disappearance, having occasion to
explore the loft of the cabin in which he
lived, he came across the remains of his
old friend. Apparently he had been more
mouse-hungry than usual, and in his haste
to satisfy his appetite had swallowed a live
mouse, which had gnawed its way through
the snake’s body, thus causing his death.</p>

<hr class='c014' />
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c013'>THIS boy and girl live in the mountains
of Switzerland. The language which
they use is a very strange one, called
<i>Schweizer-Deutsch</i> (Swiss-German).</p>

<p class='c007'>These children in the picture are dressed
up in their Sunday clothes to have their
photographs taken. When they go home
to the little village way up on the mountain
side they will take off these garments
and put on their everyday things. Hans
will draw a long-sleeved black apron over
his school suit, and then, fastening on his
back the wooden pail which you see in the
picture, will run down the steep cobble-stoned
street, with his shoes clattering at
every step, to the big stone fountain to
draw water for his mother. It takes a
long time to draw that pail of water, for
all the boys run out to hear about what
he saw in Berne that day when he had his
photograph taken. So Hans tells them
about the two big bears in the bear pit,
to whom he and Gretchen threw some
bits of bread and an apple; about the tall
clock tower built three or four hundred
years ago, where carved bears march
around and strike a big gong every hour.
You know that Berne is full of bears. The
coat of arms of the city is a bear with a
banner, and not only have live bears been
maintained at public expense for many,
many years, but bears of all kinds, carved
in wood and stone, painted, or wrought in
plaster, are seen everywhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>Hans has at last filled his pail and hurries
back to the house, whose thatched
roof is so low that it almost touches the
ground. Gretchen has taken off her grandmother’s
clothes and is busy helping the
mother prepare supper. She is very proud
of the fact that her pretty filagree chains
and pins, together with her velvet bodice
and delicate muslin waist, were worn by
the dear old grandmother,
on whose
grave she lays
fresh flowers every
Sunday. By and
by they all draw
the straight
wooden chairs to
the table and the
father says a simple
prayer. Hans
and Gretchen eat
thankfully the
black bread and
creamy cheese
which was made
last summer up on
the Alps high
above them, where
the snow flowers
bloom and the
winds blow cold from the glaciers.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the curfew bell in the church
tower rings out at sundown Hans and
Gretchen tumble into their bed on the top
of the stove. Yes, really, on the top of the
big, square white porcelain stove! It is
a good, warm place, although it never gets
hot, and even on bitter January nights,
covered with a big red feather bed, the
children are only comfortably warm. They
cannot fall off because the father has
placed high boards on each side of the
bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Early in the morning, by the light of a
candle, they drink coffee, with plenty of
milk, but no sugar. It is only on great
festivals, like birthdays and Christmas, that
they taste sugar or cake. By seven o’clock
Hans buckles on his knapsack, in which
he carries his books, and after helping
Gretchen to adjust hers they both run
gayly off to school, each one carrying in a
roomy basket a huge chunk of black bread
to eat at ten o’clock.</p>

She rarely looked out, but the moment we
got angry she always seemed to know, and
her kind and gentle voice would come
through the window, saying, “Sing it, children!
Sing it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Once I remember we were playing marbles,
and I shouted out to my brother:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You cheated!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You did!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sing it, children, sing it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>We were silent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sing it, children!”</p>

<p class='c007'>We continued silent. We couldn’t sing
it. We began to feel ashamed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then came the sweet voice, the sweetest
but one I ever heard, singing to the tune
of “O, How I Love Jesus” the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O Willie, you cheated!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>O Willie, you cheated!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>O Willie, you cheated!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But I didn’t cheat you!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It sounded so ridiculous we all burst
out laughing.</p>

<p class='c007'>You cannot sing when you are angry;
you cannot sing when you are mean; you
cannot sing when you are scared. In
other words, you cannot sing unless you
feel in some degree faith, or hope, or
charity.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think of God as at the window of
heaven. So long as he hears us singing
he knows we are filled with a sweet and
lovely spirit.</p>

school lesson. It was Saturday
afternoon, and the time was passing; but
she had been busy with her dolls dress,
and the lesson was yet unlearned. At
length her elder sister took a Bible and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, Mary, I will help you to learn
your lesson, and you can go back to your
play.” Mary came to her sisters side ready
to begin her lesson, when she suddenly
began:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sister, let us study it out of grandfather’s
Bible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what difference can it make?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, grandfather’s Bible is so much
more interesting than yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O no, Mary, they are just the same,
exactly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” replied the observing child, “I

<h3 class='c011'>WORTHY OF A MEDAL.</h3>
<hr class='c014' />
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c013'>SEVERAL years ago there were two
seals in the “Zoo” garden at Amsterdam
which were so fond of their keeper
that they could recognize his voice a long
way off, and would go to meet him.</p>

<p class='c007'>These seals also became attached to an
old gentleman and his little granddaughter,
who often went to see them in company
with a little woolly dog, and who always
took the seals something nice to eat. These
animals were kept in a large pond, and
they would come out of the water on seeing
their friends and sit down with them
to have a good time on the sand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The small dog was very lively on these
occasions, and he and the seals would frolic
together as though they belonged to the
same family, and shared the fruit and cakes
from the little girl’s basket.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, however, just in the midst of
their fun, the dog fell into the pond, and,
after struggling for a moment in the water,
he sank. The seals uttered a cry of dismay
as he disappeared, and then, flopping
to the pond, they plunged in. In an instant
the larger one had seized the half-drowned
dog, and, carrying him very tenderly
in his mouth, placed the dripping
animal at his mistress’s feet.</p>

who lived for a number of
years as a poor fisherman in his own Scotch
village, enduring the hardship of the men
who win their living from the sea, his rank
being meanwhile unknown. Finally he declared
his position and assumed the rights
of his place, and now the men whenever
they were in trouble brought to him their
grievances, with a feeling of certainty that
he knew their sufferings and would sympathize
with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Jesus, having once lived in the flesh,
and for our sakes became poor, and having
suffered weariness, hunger, thirst, bitter
temptations, and finally death itself, knows
all our human estate, our sorrows, cares,
and anxieties, and ever sympathizes with
us with infinite tenderness and love. We
have not a Saviour who cannot understand
all that comes to us. He was a baby, a
child, a man. He was despised and honored;
loved and hated; tenderly cared for
and finally killed by envious hearts. So,
you see, he will understand anything we

that much-valued member of the family.
A look of dismay crossed the baby’s face,
and she turned hastily. “Excuse me,
Prince,” she pleaded, as she laid her snowflake
of a hand caressingly on the dog’s
head. Prince thumped his tail heavily as
if to say, “It’s all right, dear little mistress.
I know it was all an accident, and you
won’t do it again, I am sure.” And the

<h3 class='c011'>THE FLOWERS AND THE WATER DROPS.</h3>
<hr class='c014' />
<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c013'>DOWN in an earth garden were some
flowers all drooping and sad. Father
Sun saw them, and calling his little children,
the sunbeams, to him, said, “To-day,
my little helpers, I need you to do
some work for me. Go down to the big,
round earth far below, and bring back to
the sky country all the water dust that
you can carry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The little sunbeams started, and although
it was a long, long journey, they were so
bright and merry that it seemed like play
to them. By and by they drew near to
Mother Earth, and before long saw myriads
of tiny drops of water, some taking hold
of hands forming part of the great ocean,
others rushing along in a strong, deep
river, while some were dancing and tumbling
in a merry little brook, singing sweet
songs. But how could the sunbeams coax
the water drops to come up into the sky
country? Surely the ocean, or the river,
or even the little laughing brooks could
not be carried up so high!</p>

<p class='c007'>But the little workers were not a bit discouraged,
and they began at once to shake
the water drops apart. The little particles
of water no sooner felt the sunbeams shaking
them than they said to each other,
“Come, now for a long ride.” And sure
enough, up, up, up they sailed in the boats
of air, helped on by the sunbeams. But
as they rose higher in the air suddenly
they began to shiver, for just then Mr.
North Wind came rushing along. How
the poor little vapor mass shook, and then
suddenly began once more to form into
drops! And some little children, far down
on the earth below, looked up at the sky
and exclaimed, “See the dark clouds up
there!” while their mamma said, “It is
going to rain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few minutes the little drops felt as
if they were being pulled back to earth,
and starting from the cloud which was
holding them, they said to one another,
“Now for a race!” And soon, patter, patter,
patter, came the sound of the rain, and
the little drops once more were back in
their earth home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ah! how the flowers lifted their drooping
heads and smiled then. If you had
been very close, you might almost have
heard them sing, “God is good! God is
good!”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
